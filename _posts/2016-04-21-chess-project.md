For this project had to create a chess board that was visually appealing and unique.

I decided that I would spend more time on the environment than the details in the pieces. My goal was to create a chess board that is floating in space and has stars around it. I personally think that the final product that I created was not what I had in mind but had its strengths. One strength is that the chess pieces have unity and are visually modern and have a clean simplistic look.

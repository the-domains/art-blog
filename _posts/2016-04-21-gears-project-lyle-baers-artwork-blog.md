description: I created this gears project which I have named Transparent Elegance with Light. The goal of this piece was to manipulate shadows and reflections with transparent materials in maya for a calming esthetic and seemingly simplistic beauty. I created this digital piece of artwork in Maya 2016 and used Mental Ray to render the Mental Ray materials.
